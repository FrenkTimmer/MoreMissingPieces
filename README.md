# MoreMissingPieces

MoreMissingPieces is a mod for Valheim that adds additional "missing" building pieces, expanding your construction options and creativity. This mod is designed for use with BepInEx and Jotunn.

> **Note:** This mod expands on the idea of the original [Missing Pieces](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/BentoG/MissingPieces/) mod by BentoG, adding even more building options.  

## Features

- Adds new building pieces to Valheim, filling gaps in the vanilla selection.
- Seamless integration with the game's building system.
